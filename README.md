## Ajax Login

This module was developed by: https://www.siphor.com/add-a-login-popup-in-magento-2/

Rather than redirecting customers to a login page, many merchants favour showing a login popup enabling the user to login without having to navigate away from the current page. To add a login popup in Magento 2 requires knowledge of JavaScript and layout usage in Magento.
